# Project2

<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>
  Some of the very worst designed websites youâ€™ll come across are for banking, credit card
  payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
  workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign this website. Additionally, you will
  add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should 
  employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.
</p>

<h4>Project Goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design</li>
  <li>Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design. </li>
  <li>Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.</li>
  <li>Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly. </li>
  li>Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience.</li>
  <li>Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based work-flow on GitHub, via pull requests and        code reviews.</li>
</ul>

<strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Whole Team: Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your team name and project number (example: Team Wonder Women - Project 2). Your post should include the full names of all team members, and a screen-by-screen task analysis of your redesign.

<strong>Second Deliverable:</strong> Whole Team: Update your project 2 Basecamp post with the URL to your group GitHub repository, live link (GitHub pages), and two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students.

<strong>Final Deliverable:</strong>Whole Team: Revise your team Basecamp post under Project 2 to add links to each member's individual fork of the group GitHub repository. Individual forks should include README.md files with following: A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.
